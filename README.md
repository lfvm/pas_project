## Game design

### **Summary**

A simple yet challenging game whose objective is to help players to learn percusion tab reading and practice rhythm sense.

The player will be able to play the game through our webpage. The player statisctics will also be available on our webpage.

### **Gameplay**

The player must press the corresponding keys to the rythm of the notes that will be apearing on screen. The more accurate the clicks are the more points the player gets. If the player misses a note the combo is reset, and if the player misses several notes in rapid succession the level ends.

### **Mentalidad**

The game objective is to make the player feel motivated to learn about rhythm and to get better coordination and cognitive abilities.
This is supposed to be a challenging game where the player must make the effort to get better and to advance the levels.

## Aspectos tecnicos

### **Screens**


1. Main Menu
    * Play
    * Options
2. Select Level
    * Back
    * Level Info (hover)
3. Game Screen
    * Pause (Esc key)
4. Pause Sceen
    * Resume
    * Re-try
    * Exit
5 Options
    * Back

### **Controls**

The player must click the notes to the rhytm.

## Dise√±o de nivel

---

Levels will be automatically generated by algorithms that generate "random" note patterns. This generated levels will be stored in the base game so all players
get the same levels.

## _Development_

---

### **Abstract Classes / Components**

1. Note
2. Lane

### **Derived Classes / Component Compositions**

1. GameController
2. LevelGenerator
3. Note
	1. SingleNote
	2. DoubleNote
	3. TripleNote
4. UIControler
5. Button
6. Life Bar
7. Music Sheet

## _Graphics_

Most game elements graphics will be made with neon colors, using sprites for the notes, music sheet, life bar.

### **Style Attributes**

The sound effects for simple actions will be minimalist sounds, emulating real life sounds (such as pressing a button) in each event that happens in the game. The more elaborate sounds will be in the notes of the main screen of the game.

It is not planned to use any specific instrument, because the game will focus on teaching rhythms, sheet music reading and coordination in general.

Moving on to the visual style, we plan to use simple and minimal sprites, in the aforementioned neon style, to reduce distractions. The sprites will be used in the notes, scores, life bar, etc.
