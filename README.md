## Game design

### **Summary**

A simple yet challenging game whose objective is to help players to learn percusion tab reading and practice rhythm sense.

The player will be able to play the game through our webpage. The player statisctics will also be available on our webpage.

### **Gameplay**

The player must press the corresponding keys to the rythm of the notes that will be apearing on screen. The more accurate the clicks are the more points the player gets. If the player misses a note the combo is reset, and if the player misses several notes in rapid succession the level ends.

### **Mentalidad**

The game objective is to make the player feel motivated to learn about rhythm and to get better coordination and cognitive abilities.
This is supposed to be a challenging game where the player must make the effort to get better and to advance the levels.

## Aspectos tecnicos

---

### **Screens**


1. Main Menu
    1. Play
    2. Options
2. Difficulty selection
3. Game/Level

### **Controls**

The player must click the notes to the rhytm.

## Dise√±o de nivel

---

Levels will be automatically generated by algorithms that generate "random" note patterns. This generated levels will be stored in the base game so all players
get the same levels.

## _Development_

---

### **Abstract Classes / Components**

1. Note
2. Lane


### **Derived Classes / Component Compositions**

1. GameController
2. LevelGenerator
3. Note
	1. SingleNote
	2. DoubleNote
	3. TripleNote

## _Graphics_

Most game elements graphics will be made with neon colors

### **Style Attributes**

Neon colors

For graphic styling, we plan to make our sprites and objects simple and minimalist to reduce distractions. Sprites and objects should maintain a consistent style.

### **Graphics Needed**

1. Background
2. Notes
	1. Single Note
	2. Double Note
	3. Triple Note
3. Lanes
4. HitArea 

## _Sounds/Music_

1. Correct note hit
2. Fail note hit
3. Menu bgm?
4. Level Complete
5. Level failed
6. Menu button click

### **Style Attributes**

Again, consistency is key. Define that consistency here. What kind of instruments do you want to use in your music? Any particular tempo, key? Influences, genre? Mood?

Stylistically, what kind of sound effects are you looking for? Do you want to exaggerate actions with lengthy, cartoony sounds (e.g. mario&#39;s jump), or use just enough to let the player know something happened (e.g. mega man&#39;s landing)? Going for realism? You can use the music style as a bit of a reference too.

 Remember, auditory feedback should stand out from the music and other sound effects so the player hears it well. Volume, panning, and frequency/pitch are all important aspects to consider in both music _and_ sounds - so plan accordingly!

### **Sounds Needed**

1. Effects
    1. Note hit
    2. Note miss
    3. Menu button click
2. Music
    1. Menu bgm
    2. Level failed
    3. Level Comlete
    3. Pause Screen

### **Music Needed**

1. Slow-paced, nerve-racking track
2. Exciting &quot;castle&quoe track
3. Happy ending credits track
